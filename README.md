# gemote
gemote is an automatic source scripter that takes emote sayings from the popular server chain noxiousnet on Garry's Mod and binds them to a single button. Supports some simple features.

## Usage
gemote is a CLI application and must be ran in your favourite terminal with the *emotes.lua* file in the same PWD as the terminal.
`$ ./gemote`
emotes.lua contains some options that let you change the key-binding, output file, and set up filters.
